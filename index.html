<p>GitHub documentation</p>
<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This project involves software using a linear regression model and its related technical documentation, developed in 3 months. We look at new approaches as we move forward. We implement sprints for project management using Agile methodology to check in weekly. Developers and technical writers arrange regular check-ins to review progress and issues together. </p>
<p>This document acts as a primary reference for all internal stakeholders. We update it regularly as the project progresses.</p>
<p>The platforms we use for this project include:</p>
<p><b>GitHub</b></p>
<p>To run code and manage the project repository, technical writers interact with the software by updating the code weekly by asking the developer team. We ensure all teams stay on the same page with the developers’ progress by documenting chunk information in each sprint.</p>
<p><b>Taiga</b></p>
<p>To manage tasks, developers and technical writers create minor tasks underneath each main task to work on achievable milestones in each sprint.</p>
<p><b>Zoom</b></p>
<p>To do a sprint retrospective weekly. We set a recurring schedule to check progress and improve communication across interdisciplinary teams.</p>
<p><b>Teams</b></p>
<p>To conduct SME interviews when technical writers have some questions about the software and want to contact the developer for better explanations and answers.</p>
<p><b>Whatsapp</b></p>
<p>To communicate informally and update work progress between teams.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We create this document for all internal professionals in our software development process, including project managers, developers, technical writers, and IT staff. We are building an AI-powered program that analyzes data from Excel files and predicts outcomes, such as investment earnings. The project integrates data science, artificial intelligence, and user interface design with Python as the primary programming language. </p>
<h1>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (concept + application to our specific project) </h1>
<p>AI, or Artificial intellect, refers to computer systems meant to do activities that typically require human intellect. These systems can </p>
<p>learn from data</p>
<p>see patterns</p>
<p>make judgments</p>
<p>solve issues</p>
<p>AI includes various technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. It is now employed in various applications, including virtual assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous cars, and medical diagnosis tools. While AI can be powerful and valuable, it is vital to remember that it is a technology designed by humans to supplement and enhance human talents rather than completely replace them.</p>
<h1>Linear Regression (concept + application to our specific project) </h1>
<p>Linear regression is a simple yet practical statistical approach used in AI and data analysis. It predicts a dependent value using one or more independent variables and fits a linear equation to observed data. </p>
<p>Consider a graph with several data points distributed over it. Linear regression tries to create a straight line that best matches these points. The line may then be used to predict future data points. While it is an early kind of artificial intelligence, it is effective for understanding variable connections and creating basic projections.</p>

<h1>Project Specific Information</h1>
<h2>Team member’s roles and responsibilities</h2>
<h2>Localization of the User Guide</h2>
<h2>Developer considerations</h2>
<h3>Python structure and source</h3>
<p>For the development of the project’s code, we are trying to follow a programing architecture called MVC which consists in separating the data from the graphical interface and making them communicate which each other to organize the interface.</p>
<p>We are also trying to separate the code into different modules. For doing that we separate the interface in different parts for example the table with the data will be a module, the 2 columns selector other, the handle missing data other… and in each module we apply the architecture described before.</p>
<p>For being able to control what are we showing in the screen, we created a main controller file called Interface.py where we program what will be on screen on each moment.</p>
<p>In GitHub we are working developing the code in a branch apart from the main branch and once we finish the sprint, we merge these 2 branches to upload the code to the main branch. For the commit (upload something to GitHub) we write a message anytime we upload something with the number of the user’s story of the task and try to explain what we did.</p>
<h3>Code errors, problems, and their solutions</h3>
<p>While developing the code we didn’t have many technical errors apart from libraries compatibility and things like that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we had some troubles with the code when we had to readapt it to fit the MVC architecture and when we divided it in modules because separating code implies to rewrite parts of the code to make the different files work together, but with patient and working together we were able to fix the problems.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest problem that we have had is adding a loading bar because we  had so many errors and we couldn’t implement it but now we are making progress with by using new programming techniques.</p>
