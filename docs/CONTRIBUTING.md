## For Developers
- Create branches: Before making changes, a separate branch will be created from the main one to work on.
- Make commits: Save the changes made in the branch with a message explaining what was changed.
- Push changes: Upload those changes to GitHub so everyone can see them.
- Make a Pull Request: Request that the changes be reviewed before adding them to the project's main branch.

## For Documenters
- Modify the README.md file: As the project progresses, the documentation team will be responsible for keeping the file updated, describing the project's development step by step.
